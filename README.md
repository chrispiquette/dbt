This is a dbt project I created where I created, transformed and publishing data tables to BigQuery after building on my machine.

[BigQuery Database link](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sproject-cp-2021!2sdbt_data!3smy_first_dbt_model&project=project-cp-2021).

### Details:
1. Setup Python.
2. Setup Visual Studio Code for Windows.
3. Configured dbt-core on my local Windows machine.
4. Added the YAML configuration file "profiles.yml" to be able to connect my machine to BigQuery.
5. Created a SQL data model in this repository, and created a second model dependent on the first.
6. Ran dbt-core and published to BigQuery.
